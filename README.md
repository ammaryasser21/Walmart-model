## Introduction
The Walmart Sales Analysis project aims to provide insightful analysis and predictions based on the Walmart dataset. By leveraging various data exploration, cleaning, transformation, and machine learning techniques, the project seeks to help Walmart owners understand critical factors influencing their sales and profitability.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises 21 columns and 9,995 rows, containing detailed information on customer orders, including order and shipping dates, customer demographics, product details, and sales figures.

**Columns:**
- Row ID
- Order ID
- Order Date
- Ship Date
- Ship Mode
- Customer ID
- Customer Name
- Segment
- Country
- City
- State
- Postal Code
- Region
- Product ID
- Category
- Sub-Category
- Product Name
- Sales
- Quantity
- Discount
- Profit

## Project Objectives
1. Identify the product category with the highest sales.
2. Determine the customer segment contributing the most to sales.
3. Analyze the regions, states, and cities that contribute the highest sales and profit.
4. Investigate the interrelationships between various factors.
5. Develop a machine learning model to predict sales.
6. Create a time series analysis of sales data.

## Methodology
The project methodology includes the following steps:
1. Understanding the dataset and defining project objectives.
2. Applying data exploration methods (summary statistics and visualizations).
3. Performing data cleaning and transformation (handling missing values, removing duplicates, handling outliers).
4. Visualizing the dataset using PowerBI.
5. Developing and evaluating a machine learning model to predict sales.
6. Conducting a time series analysis of sales data.

## Data Exploration
- Summary Statistics: Provide an overview of the dataset, including mean, median, standard deviation, and other statistical measures.
- Visualizations: Use histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and box plots to visualize the distribution and relationships of various columns.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Handling Missing Values: Implement methods to address missing data points.
- Removing Duplicates: Ensure the dataset does not contain duplicate entries.
- Handling Outliers: Identify and manage outliers to maintain data integrity.

## Visualization
- Use PowerBI to create interactive visualizations that highlight key insights from the dataset.
- Visualizations include sales distribution by product category, customer segment, region, and time.

## Machine Learning Model
- Develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques.
- Train the model on historical sales data and evaluate its performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R^2.

## Time Series Analysis
- Conduct a time series analysis of sales data using the Order Date and Sales columns.
- Identify trends, seasonal patterns, and forecast future sales.

## Conclusion
Summarize the findings and insights from the project. Provide recommendations for Walmart owners on which products, regions, categories, and customer segments to target or avoid.
